Heat oil in a pan on medium heat. Once oil is hot, add cloves and peppercorn.

Saute for few seconds till fragrant and then add cumin seeds and mustard seeds. Wait till cumin seeds sizzle and mustard seeds start popping out.

Add chopped onions now and cook for 2-3 minutes or till they start turning light brown in color.

Add garlic, ginger and green chili and mix. Cook for another 2 minutes or till raw smell of ginger and garlic goes away.

Add pureed tomatoes and mix. Cover the pan and cook for 5 minutes on medium heat.

Open the pan and add salt, coriander powder, turmeric powder, garam masala powder and kashmiri red chili powder. Cover the pan again and cook for another 6-7 minutes.

Once the tomatoes and spices are nicely cooked, add 1 cup of water to the pan. Add less water for a thicker consistency or more for thinner.

Add boiled eggs, green peas [frozen] and mix. Simmer the curry for 5-6 minutes on medium-low heat.

Add chopped cilantro, cover the pan and simmer for another 2 minutes.

Serve egg curry with any bread of your choice. It also tastes great with rice.

* Using green peas is optional. You may skip it. You may add potatoes to the curry is you like.

* Adjust spice levels to taste. You may add red chili powder for a spicier curry. The kashmiri red chili powder is used mostly for color.

* You may cut the eggs in half before adding to the curry.
